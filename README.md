# Titanic Survival Prediction with Random Forest

This project uses the classic **Titanic** dataset to predict passenger survival outcomes using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

## Project Overview

A complete machine learning pipeline was developed to:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Explore and visualize relevant variables
- Train and optimize a Random Forest model
- Evaluate model performance on the test set

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results

A Random Forest Classifier was trained and achieved an accuracy of approximately **%** on the validation data. The model was then used to generate predictions for the test set.
